An overview of the paper “[Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overfitting](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/srivastava14a.pdf)”.

The author proposes a novel approach called Dropout. All images and tables in this post are from their paper.

## Introduction

The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different “thinned” networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods.
With unlimited computation, the best way to “regularize” a fixed-sized model is to average the predictions of all possible settings of the parameters, weighting each setting by its posterior probability given the training data. At test time, it is not feasible to explicitly average the predictions from exponentially many thinned models. However, a very simple approximate averaging method works well in practice. The idea is to use a single neural net at test time without dropout. The weights of this network are scaled-down versions of the trained weights. If a unit is retained with probability p during training, the outgoing weights of that unit are multiplied by p at test time.

## Backpropagation

Dropout neural networks can be trained using stochastic gradient descent in a manner similar to standard neural nets. The only difference is that for each training case in a mini-batch, we sample a thinned network by dropping out units. Forward and backpropagation for that training case are done only on this thinned network. The gradients for each parameter are averaged over the training cases in each mini-batch. Any training case which does not use a parameter contributes a gradient of zero for that parameter.

Interestingly, there is a very nice regularization which goes well along with dropout - constraining the norm of the incoming weight vector at each hidden unit to be upper bounded by a fixed constant c (Max norm regularization). The constant c is a tunable hyperparameter, which is determined using a validation set. It typically improves the performance of stochastic gradient descent training of deep neural nets, even when no dropout is used. Although dropout alone gives significant improvements, using dropout along with max-norm regularization, large decaying learning rates and high momentum provides a significant boost over just using dropout.

## Unsupervised Pretraining

Pretraining is an effective way of making use of unlabeled data. Pretraining followed by finetuning with backpropagation has been shown to give significant performance boosts over finetuning from random initializations in certain cases. Dropout can be applied to finetune nets that have been pretrained using these techniques. The pretraining procedure stays the same. The weights obtained from pretraining should be scaled up by a factor of 1/p. This makes sure that for each unit, the expected output from it under random dropout will be the same as the output during pretraining. Note that the stochastic nature of dropout might wipe out the information in the pretrained weights when learning rate is large. Upon reducing the learning rate, the pre-trained features are not lost completely.

## Effect on features

In a standard neural network, the derivative received by each parameter tells it how it should change so the final loss function is reduced, given what all other units are doing. Therefore, units may change in a way that they fix up the mistakes of the other units. This may lead to complex co-adaptations. This in turn leads to overfitting because these co-adaptations do not generalize to unseen data. We hypothesize that for each hidden unit, dropout prevents co-adaptation by making the presence of other hidden units unreliable. Therefore, a hidden unit cannot rely on other specific units to correct its mistakes. It must perform well in a wide variety of different contexts provided by the other hidden units.

## Effect on Sparsity

The authors found that as a side-effect of doing dropout, the activations of the hidden units become sparse, even when no sparsity inducing regularizers are present. Thus, dropout automatically leads to sparse representations.
