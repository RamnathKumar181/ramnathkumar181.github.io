I am a graduate of <a href=https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/>BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus</a>, where I pursued a B.E. in Computer Science and Msc. in Economics.</p>

<p>
    I have been fortunate enough to be advised by some of the best researchers in the field of AI, including
    <a href=https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/engineering_and_computing/faculty-staff/amitsheth.php>Amit Sheth</a> and
    <a href=https://people.wright.edu/t.k.prasad>T.K. Prasad</a> at <a href=https://engineering-computer-science.wright.edu/lab/knoesis>Kno.e.sis</a>,
    <a href=https://mila.quebec/en/person/karim-jerbi/>Karim Jerbi</a> from Cognitive & Computational Neuroscience Lab, University of Montreal, and
    <a href=https://mila.quebec/en/person/samira-ebrahimi-kahou/>Samira Kahou</a> from <a href=https://mila.quebec/en/>MILA</a>. Previously, I also worked
    as a consultant at <a href=https://mila.quebec/en/>MILA</a> advised by <a href=https://yoshuabengio.org/>Yoshua Bengio</a>. Recently, I used to work as a Research Associate at Google
    in the Machine Learning and Optimization Dept. with <a href="https://dheerajnagaraj.com/">Dheeraj Nagaraj</a>, and have currently transitioned to a Pre-Doctoral Researcher role at the same 
    organization under the supervision of <a href="https://www.prateekjain.org/">Prateek Jain</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~inderjit/">Inderjit Dhillon</a>.

<p>
My research interests lie broadly in generalization, causality, theoretical machine learning, and real-world representation learning.

<p>
I also use this website to blog about research that interests me. In my spare time, I enjoy gaming and playing badminton.
