I am currently pursuing my PhD in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.cs.ucla.edu">University of California, Los Angeles</a> working under the guidance of <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~chohsieh/">Cho-Jui Hsieh</a>. Previously, I was a Pre-Doctoral Researcher at <a href="https://deepmind.google">Google DeepMind India</a> and have also worked at <a href="https://research.google">Google Research India</a> at the <em>Machine Learning & Optimization (MLO)</em>, and <em>Ads ML</em> teams respectively working with <a href="https://www.prateekjain.org">Prateek Jain</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~inderjit/">Inderjit Dhillon</a>. During this time, I had the invaluable opportunity to work alongside and learn from few exceptional mentors:
<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~asuggala/">Arun Sai Suggala</a>, and
<a href="https://dheerajnagaraj.com/">Dheeraj Nagaraj</a>.
I completed my B.E. in Computer Science and MSc. in Economics from Birla Institute of Technology and Science (<a href=https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/>BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus</a>).
I am grateful to be supported by the <a href="https://www.ucla.edu">UCLA</a> Graduate Dean's Scholar Award, and the <a href=https://www.quadfellowship.org/2024-quad-fellows>Quad Fellowship</a>, awarded by <a href="https://www.iie.org">International Institute of Education</a>.

Previously, I worked as a consultant at <a href=https://mila.quebec/en/>Mila - Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute</a>, where I had the privilege of working with <a href=https://yoshuabengio.org/>Yoshua Bengio</a>. Beyond that, I've also had the opportunity to engage in various informal collaborations with several esteemed professors around his lab. Over the years, I've also been fortunate to work closely with leading AI research teams across the globe including <a href=https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/engineering_and_computing/faculty-staff/amitsheth.php>Amit Sheth</a> and <a href=https://people.wright.edu/t.k.prasad>T.K. Prasad</a> at <a href=https://engineering-computer-science.wright.edu/lab/knoesis>Wright State University</a>, <a href=https://www.amazon.science/locations/bengaluru>Amazon ML</a>, and numerous talented peers from my alma mater.

My research interests broadly cover <b>deep learning</b>, focusing on designing <b>robust</b> and <b>efficient</b> techniques for practical deep learning systems. As machine learning continues to expand into real-world applications, ensuring models are both robust and efficient have become more critical than ever. In my free time, I enjoy gaming, badminton and swimming.
