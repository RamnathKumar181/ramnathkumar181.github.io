I am a Pre-Doctoral Researcher at Google Research India, under the guidance <a href="https://www.prateekjain.org/">Prateek Jain</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~inderjit/">Inderjit Dhillon</a>.
Throughout this period, I've had the privilege of learning from two exceptional mentors: <a href="https://dheerajnagaraj.com/">Dheeraj Nagaraj</a>, and <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~asuggala/">Arun Sai Suggala</a>.
Previously, I pursued my B.E. in Computer Science and Msc. in Economics from <a href=https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/>BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus</a>.</p>


<p>
    Prior to this, I also worked as a consultant at <a href=https://mila.quebec/en/>MILA</a> advised by <a href=https://yoshuabengio.org/>Yoshua Bengio</a>.
    I have been fortunate enough to work with few strong research teams across the world in the field of AI, including
    <a href=https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/engineering_and_computing/faculty-staff/amitsheth.php>Amit Sheth</a> and
    <a href=https://people.wright.edu/t.k.prasad>T.K. Prasad</a> at <a href=https://engineering-computer-science.wright.edu/lab/knoesis>Kno.e.sis</a>,
    <a href=https://mila.quebec/en/person/karim-jerbi/>Karim Jerbi</a> from Cognitive & Computational Neuroscience Lab, University of Montreal,
    <a href=https://mila.quebec/en/person/samira-ebrahimi-kahou/>Samira Kahou</a> from <a href=https://mila.quebec/en/>MILA</a>, and Dr. Gokul Swamy from <a href=https://www.amazon.science/locations/bengaluru>Amazon ML</a>.

My research interests are broadly in the domain of <b>deep learning</b>, and in particular,
I am interested in designing <b>robust</b> and <b>efficient</b> techniques for practical deep learning systems.
In the ever-growing application of machine learning in real-world scenarios, it becomes imperative for models to
exhibit qualities of robustness, efficiency, and more.</p>

I also use this website to blog about research that interests me. In my spare time, I enjoy gaming and playing badminton.
