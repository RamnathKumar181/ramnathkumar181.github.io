I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of California, Los Angeles working with <a href="https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~chohsieh/">Prof. Cho-Jui Hsieh</a>. Previously, I was a Pre-Doctoral Researcher at Google DeepMind and also worked at Google Research India, under the guidance of <a href="https://www.prateekjain.org/">Prateek Jain</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~inderjit/">Inderjit Dhillon</a>.
During this period, I also had the privilege of learning from two exceptional mentors: <a href="https://dheerajnagaraj.com/">Dheeraj Nagaraj</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~asuggala/">Arun Sai Suggala</a>.
I completed my B.E. in Computer Science and MSc. in Economics from <a href=https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/>BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus</a>.
I am grateful to be supported by the UCLA Graduate Dean's Scholar Award and the <a href=https://www.quadfellowship.org/2024-quad-fellows>Quad Fellowship</a>.

Prior to this, I also worked as a consultant at <a href=https://mila.quebec/en/>MILA</a>, advised by <a href=https://yoshuabengio.org/>Yoshua Bengio</a>.
I have been fortunate to collaborate with leading research teams worldwide in AI, including
<a href=https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/engineering_and_computing/faculty-staff/amitsheth.php>Amit Sheth</a> and
<a href=https://people.wright.edu/t.k.prasad>T.K. Prasad</a> at <a href=https://engineering-computer-science.wright.edu/lab/knoesis>Knoesis</a>,
and Gokul Swamy from <a href=https://www.amazon.science/locations/bengaluru>Amazon ML</a>.

My research interests broadly cover <b>deep learning</b>, focusing on designing <b>robust</b> and <b>efficient</b> techniques for practical deep learning systems. As machine learning continues to expand into real-world applications, ensuring models are both robust and efficient has become more critical than ever. 
In my free time, I enjoy gaming, badminton and swimming.
