I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of California, Los Angeles working with <a href="https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~chohsieh/">Prof. Cho-Jui Hsieh</a>. Previously, I was a Pre-Doctoral Researcher at Google DeepMind and have also worked at Google Research India under the guidance of <a href="https://www.prateekjain.org/">Prateek Jain</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~inderjit/">Inderjit Dhillon</a>.
During this time, I had the invaluable opportunity to work alongside — and learn from few exceptional mentors:
<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/karthikeyan-shanmugam">Karthikeyan Shanmugam</a>,
<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~asuggala/">Arun Sai Suggala</a>, and
<a href="https://dheerajnagaraj.com/">Dheeraj Nagaraj</a>.
I completed my B.E. in Computer Science and MSc. in Economics from <a href=https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/>BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus</a>.
I am grateful to be supported by the UCLA Graduate Dean's Scholar Award and the <a href=https://www.quadfellowship.org/2024-quad-fellows>Quad Fellowship</a>.

Previously, I worked as a consultant at <a href=https://mila.quebec/en/>MILA</a>, where I had the privilege of being advised by <a href=https://yoshuabengio.org/>Prof. Yoshua Bengio</a>. Beyond that, I've also had the opportunity to engage in various informal collaborations with several esteemed professors around his lab. Over the years, I've also been fortunate to work closely with leading AI research teams across the globe including <a href=https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/engineering_and_computing/faculty-staff/amitsheth.php>Amit Sheth</a> and <a href=https://people.wright.edu/t.k.prasad>T.K. Prasad</a> at <a href=https://engineering-computer-science.wright.edu/lab/knoesis>Knoesis</a>, Gokul Swamy from <a href=https://www.amazon.science/locations/bengaluru>Amazon ML</a>, and numerous talented peers from my alma mater.

My research interests broadly cover <b>deep learning</b>, focusing on designing <b>robust</b> and <b>efficient</b> techniques for practical deep learning systems. As machine learning continues to expand into real-world applications, ensuring models are both robust and efficient have become more critical than ever.
In my free time, I enjoy gaming, badminton and swimming.
